# PTM4SE
Recent years, deep learning has achieved excellent performance in Software Engineering (SE) tasks. However, excellent performance relies on large-scale training sets, which prevents the application of deep learning techniques in practical tasks. With the release of pre-trained models (PTMs) in the field of deep learning, researchers in SE have begun to pay attention to PTMs, and introduced PTMs into SE tasks. PTMs has made a qualitative leap in SE tasks, which makes intelligent software engineering enter a new era. However, none of the studies have refined the success, failure, and opportunities of pre-trained models in SE. To clarify the work in this cross-field (PTM4SE: Pre-trained models for Software Engineering), we systematically review the current studies related to PTM4SE. Specifically, we firstly describe the framework of the intelligent software engineering methods based on pre-trained models. We then analyze and discuss the commonly used pre-trained models in SE. Meanwhile, we introduce the downstream tasks in SE with pre-trained models in detail, and compare and analyze the performance of pre-trained model techniques on these tasks. We then present the datasets used in SE for training and fine-tuning the PTMs. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities for PTM4SE.
