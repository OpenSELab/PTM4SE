Added an initial implementation of an index for the scm repositories.
The commit message, the revision and repository url are indexed, which
allows to search for all commits for a task in specific repositories.
Currently, the index is rebuild at the startup, which limits its use
only for smaller git projects. This should be fixed in the near future,
when a notification of repository changes is implemented, as well as
a mechanism, which determines if the repository has changed while
eclipse was not running.

* JOO-30: Type casts are now left out is a function is assumed to be a type. Since you can also import package-namespaced functions (not supported by Jangaroo, but could be ""native"" JavaScript), there is a heuristic that uppercase imports declare types.

* keywords ""use"", ""namespace""
* ""use namespace"" directive
* namespaced member declarations
* namespaced property access: bean.namespace::property
* include and import without semicolon
* hex literals (0xFFFFFFFF) are now parsed as Long (Number in JS anyway)
* object literals in initializers (used to lead to ""invalid label"" in runtime). Adding brackets may fix other non-working initializers, too.
* ""new MyClass"" without brackets
* ""delete bean.property"" now is a boolean expression, not a statement
* ?: expressions allow object literals (but not for condition, which makes no sense and leads to syntactic ambigiouties)
* ""dynamic"" modifier, without making ""dynamic"" a keyword!
* added grace to duplicate declarations: seems to be ""worst practice"" to reuse catch variable.
Runtime:
* ignore imports at class member level
* ignore other syntax than imports on top level (e.g. ""use namespace ..."", annotation, ...)
New semantics supported:
* multiple catch clauses of different exception types are transformed to catch(e){if(is(e,Type1){...}else if (is(e,Type2){...}else{...}}
* include ""file"", now unit-tested!
* function-syntax type casts, now unit-tested!
* integer names for object literals (""{ 1: 'foo', 2: 'bar'}"").
Fixes:
* operator precedence now according to reference
* annotation comment output: added missing braces output
* moved type cast detection from analyze phase to generate-code phase, because references to members declared after their usage were not detected (added unit test)
* refactored injection of code in BlockStatement: it is now done through a CodeGenerator call-back instead of as special cases inside BlockStatement. This pattern is used if a preceding construct has to generate code inside the following code block (parameter initializer, super call).
* simplified DotExpr code: it's arg2 is always an IdeExpr, centralized this type cast!
* added some more generics
Open issues:
* one the way to support other compilation units besides ""class"": ""namespace"" and ""function"" should also be possible!

Motivation
----------
This changeset adds the capabilities to pass in a raw (already encoded)
JSON document, largely driven by the fact that users may already have their
JSON stack set up and just want to pass in the data. We do not want to get
in the way.
Modifications
-------------
Adds the raw JSON document which justs takes the string, expects its valid,
creates a buffer out of it and stores it down. This also is very low overhead.
Result
------
More flexibility in dealing with JSON documents in combination with custom
JSON marshallers.

5a408ffe3987ce5d91b841038122f38907f90774,ngdata$lilyproject,"Started introducing the management around indexes. In this new design, there can be any number of indexes, each with their own configuration and pointing to different SOLR instances. The configuration data of the indexes is stored persistently in ZooKeeper. ZooKeeper watches are used to trigger various components when the configuration changes. An index can be in different states such as ready, rebuilding, disabled, and others. This new structure allows for more flexibility and provides a way for integrating and managing index rebuilding.
The new design consists of the following major components: indexer engine (= the existing indexer code), indexer model, indexer master, indexer worker, indexer admin CLI. I will explain these in more detail on the mailing list.
Note that these changes invalidate the indexer-related instructions in the 'Running Lily' document.
Currently it is only the very basics which are done: only indexes in 'ready' state can be created.
Other/related changes:
* Move json utility classes from lily-repo-util to new lily-json-util package, so that projects that need json don't need a dependency on lily repo
* ZooKeeper: went for approach where 1 instance of ZK is instantiated (by the general-module) and exported for use by the other modules (this required adding an ZooKeeperItf interface). Not sure yet what the best appraoch is, will depend on how we will handle connection/session loss and whether the single-dispatch thread for watchers is an issue or not.
* Added a generic ZooKeeper-based lock, which blocks until the lock is obtained. See class ZkLock.
* IndexUpdater does not call LinkIndexUpdater anymore. Previously it was done this way to assure the link index was updated before the index entry for a certain record. However, since there is only one LinkIndex but there can be multiple LinkIndexUpdaters (for different indexes), this did not make sense anymore. The logical thing to do was to update the LinkIndex as a write-ahead-log action.
* RowLogImpl: store the consumers in a TreeMap, so that they will be used in the order of their IDs, this way we can influence the execution order for write-ahead-log secondary actions (temporary solution until we have some sort of configuration for this). Augmented the consumer ID of the MessageQueueFeeder to 10 so there is room for things to execute before it.

Note: for the time being, violation errors will not appear in the Problems

error markers that denote inclusion in the error page. Will check out
the use of annotations to deal with this...
For evaluation:
The size and scope of the rule editor is (I believe) outgrowing its
placement within its preference page and it needs to be parked within
it own view. Besides, tracking all the edits being made to the rules
goes beyond what the pref pages can handle (i.e. apply/cancel...
which never worked properly for the rules in any case)
To that end, I've copied the rule table into its own view for now and
left the one in the preference page as is so we can compare & contrast.
Only one will remain by the time the best approach is chosen.

Rewrite into a core library with simple methods and an abstraction layer on
top of the backend system.
The following backends are implemented
* Memory (for testing; only works within a single JVM)
* ZooKeeper (proof-of-concept implementation of the backend)
The following libraries are created:
* Service discovery library
This brings the overall functionality on par with 2.x with a few exceptions:
* Locking isn't implemented. That did not work for the old library so
there's no real change in functionality
* It isn't possible to query *everything* from a client. This will be
addressed in another commit (or just ignored completely since the
backends offers this in some shape or form)
* It isn't possible to resolve coordinates partially, f.e. finding
""logserver"" when your own coordinate is ""service.tag.region"";
""logserver"" should resolve to ""logserver.tag.region"". This will
be solved in a later commit by making a separate resolver class that
creates service coordinates based on existing coordinates.

exception is thrown while processing the operation the operation
status reports the message from that exception.

When using SlicePredicate for range queries, Hector expects both start and
finish values to be set. This is not the best behavior.
For example, Cassandra allows to query for the 'first N columns' simply by
setting start and finish values to empty string and setting count to N.
Although this query can be performed with String/StringSerializer, with
UUID/UUIDSerializer it can't be done. To get 'first N columns' of type UUID,
one has to generate min/max UUID's and use these as range values.

to JDOM!  Now instead of using the slow and broken PartialList to
make lists live, we'll be using a faster and smarter FilterList
mechanism.
This check-in also integrates the Text class that has been
developed but previously not actually used.
It's a major change and has taken a long time to design, develop,
and test in the jdom-wip workspace.  Thanks to Alex Rosen, Bradley
S. Huffman, and Jools Enticknap for doing all the coding work.
The code I'm integrating here is absolutely beautiful!
Added classes:
AttributeFilter
DocumentContentFilter
ElementContentFilter
ElementFilter
Filter
FilterList
Removed classes:
PartialList
Integrated classes:
Text
Added methods:
CDATA.getTextTrim()
CDATA.getTextNormalize()
CDATA.append(String)
CDATA.append(CDATA)
CDATA.getParent()
CDATA.getDocument()
CDATA.detach()
Element.addContent(Text)
Element.removeContent(Text)
This check-in also removes almost all the methods that were
deprecated in beta7.  If you were getting deprecation warnings
before, they're going to be errors now.  Heads up.
This isn't a simple change, so for those who don't want to take the
leap just yet, the CVS tag ""jdom_prefilter"" marks the codebase before
this check-in.  I hope everyone tries out the new code though.  It
should be faster and consume fewer resources to traverse a tree, and
all the live list methods are implemented now too!
Please report your experiences to the jdom-interest list.

Below is his 6/4/2003 email.  I tagged the code ""before_rolf"" so
if we decide to back this out it's easy.

I have had a look at the Child/Parent thing.
Personally, I don't think the Idea has been taken far enough, so I
played around with the concept, and ""normalised"" some of the
redundancies.
Firstly, I converted the Child interface into an Abstract class that
deals with ALL Parent/child relationships for the Child role,
including detaching, cloning, set/getParent (and holds the parent
instance field).
I also implemented getDocument at the Child Class level (all children
have the same mechanism for getting the Document).
Next, I added the method ""getDocument"" to the Parent Interface... and
parent can getDocument, including the Document class which has ""return
this;"" in the getDocument().
Finally, I changed the ContentList class substantially. elementData is
now called childData, and is of type Child[] instead of Object[]. The
ContentList owner is now of type Parent instead of Object. I have
added a method canContain to the Parent interface, and thus the actual
Parent object determines what content is allowed in the contentlist,
so instead of add(int,Text), add(int,Element), add(int,CDATA),
add(int,ProcessingInstruction), etc, there is just add(int, Child).
In doing all of the above, I have cut large amounts of
redundant/duplicated code, simplified the relationships, and thrown
away ""special cases"". The only downside I can see in terms of
""functionality"" is that some of the exceptions are thrown with less
specialised messages...
Please have a look, and comment on the concept. Note, that this is
only possible by converting Child to an abstract class instead of
an interface.
