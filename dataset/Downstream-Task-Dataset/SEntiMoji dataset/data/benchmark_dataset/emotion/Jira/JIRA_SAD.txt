If someone wants to take this over, that's cool - I'm unlikely to have time in the next week and a half, though.	1
It is a nasty bug that I've seen in real life, though.	1
Here's another crack at this:1) The default behavior for Derby is the current behavior with all of its security holes for java routines.	0
2) To get secure behavior for java routines, the customer has to explicitly opt-in.	0
Let's be vague about what that entails right now.	0
3) If you do opt-in, then you get the SQL standard behavior:   3a) Jar ids are mandatory.	0
Instead, to access methods in the JRE you have to include little wrapper methods in your jar files that you loaded into the database.	0
3c) The search order for customer-written routines is SQL standard: First we look in the jar file where the routine lives.	0
Then we look in the other jar files in the order specified by SQLJ.ALTER_JAVA_PATH.	0
Then we defer to the system class loader.	0
3d) At runtime, when we invoke the routine, we make sure that it actually lives in the declared jar file.	0

In the wiki next to each one of these parameters it explicitly says that reducing this parameter will decrease memory usage, this is why we reduced these parameters (it did not mention the filterCache at all).	0
They will save RAM to a certain extent for certain situations.	0
But not very helpful at the sizes you are working with (and not settings I would use to save RAM anyway, unless the amount I need to save was pretty small).	0
Also, the savings are largely index side - not likely a huge part of your RAM concerns, which are search side.	0
My filterCache stats are great- you know it's set to 64K but right now, with almost all the RAM used up (we're at 71.9% now), but it's only using 36290 entries at the moment and it's holding pretty steady there(even as RAM usage increased by 10%).	0
None of the other caches have gone up much either.	0
We have no cache evictions, at all, but a 99% hit ratio.	0
The sizes may be higher than you need then.	0
They should be adjusted to the best settings based on the wiki info.	0
I was originally suggesting you might sacrifice speed with the caches for RAM - but, its always best to use the best settings and have the necessary RAM.	0
Yes exactly -- sorry to be so unclear.	1
Just really wondering/hoping you'd be interested in working on these ??	0
I'd like to get them cleaned up because there are now so many that other more important and/or meaningful warnings are likely to be ignored.	0

Commited a fix for this into trunk using revision 610846.	0
I will work on merging this into 10.3 codeline and writing a test case.	0
The tests ran fine on my Windows XP machine with Sun jdk1.4 The commit comments are as followsDERBY-3302 The user was running into null pointer exception at the time of database recoverybecause Derby was trying to get the Collator object through database context.	0
But the Collator object is already available in the territory sensitive character classes and wedo not have to go to database context to get it.	0
I changed the code to use that collator object rather than look into database context.	0
The reason for null pointer exception was that database context was not loaded yet during database recovery.	0

Claus, I think I'm busy the next two weeks with [CAMEL-3468|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-3468], [CAMEL-3472|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-3472], [CAMEL-3471|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-3471], [CAMEL-3470|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-3470] and [CAMEL-3311|https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/CAMEL-3311].	0
Depending of the release date for Camel 2.6 and the priority of the other issues (may be I can reschedule [CAMEL-3471|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-3471] and/or other issues), I can do it in the remaining time.	0

Is the bug really in NGramTokenFilter?	0
This seems to be a larger problem that would affect all tokenfilters that break larger tokensinto smaller ones and recalculate offsets, right?	0
For example: EdgeNGramTokenFilter, ThaiWordFilter, SmartChineseAnalyzer's WordTokenFilter, etc?	0
I think WordDelimiterFilter has special code that might avoid the problem (line 352), so it mightbe ok.Is there any better way we could solve this: for example maybe instead of the tokenizer callingcorrectOffset() it gets called somewhere else?	0
This seems to be what is causing the problem.	0
Uploading another patch for fixing the maven pattern to add the classifier.	0
I don't see the connection to .tmp files.	0
(Also: have you verified that the channel will actually infinite-loop returning 0?	0
Kind of odd behavior, although I guess it's technically within-spec.)	0
IncomingStreamReader does clean the tmp file when there is an expection (there's an enclosing 'try catch').	0
The problem is that no exception is raised if the other side of the connection dies.	0
What will happen then is the read will infinitely read 0 bytes.	0
So this actually avoid the infinite loop returning 0 (and so I think answered your second question, so it wasn't very clear).	0
Note that without this patch, there is an infinite loop that will hold a socket open forever (and consume cpu, though very few probably in that case).	0
So this is not just merely a fix of deleting the tmp files.	0
But it does as a consequence of correctly raising an exception when should be.	0
<joes4> lists will be available in 1 hour from now.	0

Cancelling current patch to upload new patch	0
To answer your questions in order:This problem only happens with the embedded driver because the Database is created inside the JVM and locked to prevent other processes to connect to it.	0

Hey Uma, I've elected not to revert the patch as-committed, since it does indeed fix the bug at hand.	0

> then we don't save IO by limiting the buffer size to 1 KBI'm confused by this.	1
My assumption is that, when you make a request to read 1k from a disk file, that the OS reads substantially more than 1k from the disk and places it in the buffer cache.	0
(The cost of randomly reading 1k is nearly the same as randomly reading 100k--both are dominated by seek.)	0
So, if you make another request to read 1k shortly thereafter you'll get it from the buffer cache and the incremental cost will be that of making a system call.	0
In general, one should thus rely on the buffer cache and read-ahead, and make input buffers only big enough so that system call overhead is insignificant.	0
An alternate strategy is to not trust the buffer cache and read-ahead, but rather to make your buffers large enough so that transfer time dominates seeks.	0
This can require 1MB or larger buffers, so isn't always practical.	0
So, back to your statement, a 1k buffer doesn't save physical i/o, but nor should it incur extra physical i/o.	0
It does incur extra system calls, but uses less memory, which is a tradeoff.	0
Is that what you meant?	0

It would be good if folks can use standard Java i/o idioms with Hadoop.	0

Shouldn't we try to make this idiom work well with HDFS?	0
This looks good, but I wish there was a good way to set up a test case.	0
I guess the best way would be to create a JobTracker and call the heartbeat method and observe the requested heartbeat interval.	0
I included the gen stamp and length in the {{cacheReport}} to handle caching newly appended data.	0
I guess the gen stamp is unnecessary, but the DN isn't going to automatically mlock newly appended data, so the NN needs to somehow realize that the cached length is shorter than the new length and ask the DN to recache at the new length.	0
Alternatively, I guess the DN could automatically mlock appended data, but there are quota implications there.	0
On startup, I agree that we can skip cache reports until the cache is populated.	0
I also agree that jittering doesn't matter as much if it's ticking on such a short time scale.	0
I guess I could have cleaned this up rather than just changing the default cache report period like Colin asked.	0
However, since we want to eventually have both incremental and full reports, let's just ape how block reports work; don't jitter the incremental reports, but do jitter the start time for the full reports and afterwards tick at a regular interval.	0
Let's clean up all these issues in the incremental cache report JIRA (HDFS-5092); if this sounds good, I'll edit the JIRA description with these todo items.	0

You are going to kill me when I say this, but it seems like we should just commit your first patch.	1

The original reason why i asked this is so that clients can seamlessly cross over like in MR between RM and AHS.	0

The change is now that in Lucene 4.0 all Analyzers are required to reuse TokenStream instances, so the StopFilter is only produced only once in your application (when the Analyzer is created).	0
You would need to implement session resume; thats a whole new can of worms.	1
Only the first of these is a failure.	0
This test pukes all over the place when the first test fails.	0
Some of the other test cases in this class failed because that constraint error occurred?	0
There were most definitely 21 test case failures.	0
<danielsh> Yes, any23.zones.apache.org is the jail's hostname, so use the IP it resolves to.	0
ill upload a patch for 3.1 and 3.2 branch as soon as ZOOKEEPER-597 gets committed to those branches.	0
Yeah, seems safe.	0
And the current behavior is irritating.	0
Will commit a bit later unless somebody beats me to it.	0
Hi Zeid,I'll go ahead and commit your changes, but this one doesn't look right...I think it's a hold over from the Mac files.	0
This symbol is not used for the Windows Netaccessor.	0
Yeah?	0
Please watch the source tree over the next several weeks before our next release.	0
There will probably be some additional file checks, so you'll need to patch the projects yet again.	0
This is the bridge code minus the redundant bit.	0
I would like that add that the problem is highly reproducible.	0
Looks great to me.	0
Thanks Doug.	0
Sorry for a mess in uploaded files, my connection got broken during first upload.	1
These file describes my change:derby1434-try2.diff (attached multiple times, should have the same content)derby1434-try2.stat	0
And it's somehow connected to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRAPI-137	0
The reason of such big number of "ByteArrayOutputStream;.write" invokes is signed ext/bcprov.jar - it's manifest is read by byte.	0
If we put this jar to bootclasspath we'll have at least 5% performance boost on HWA application .	0
btw: maybe we should add this Jira's as subtasks to HARMONY-5277 ?	0
As they're startup related.	0
Ok, all donehttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KATOI found sgoyal jira username to be shubham so hope thats right, if so good to go!	0

Here are 2 patches ... one for adjustExamplePaths.bat & .shand the other a new file holding 2 User Libraries ... UIMA_LIB & UIMA_AS_LIBNot sure where this should go ...	1
I guessed UIMA_HOME/config but could be /lib	0
The only thing that the convention plugin does at request time, happens in org.apache.struts2.convention.ConventionUnknownHandler, the rest is just configuration loading on start up, you might want to put a breakpoint in handleUnknownAction, and see what is going on.	0
So either new-style hints are being written without versionColumn by RowMutation.hintFor, or old style hints did not get cleaned out properly by SystemTable.purgeIncompatibleHints.	0
But both of those look fine to me.	0

Thanks Mathias.	0
This is a silly one.	1
Bringing into 0.90.0.	0
Marking as critical.	0
Seems we didn't enforce an exec for sh, but we did for fs.	1
@JonThanks for committing it.	0
Anoop reminded me about this.	0
The failure of GdiplusStartup happened to because this function was called from a native method with RSP not aligned to 16 bytes.	0
It is not well documented in MSDN, but it looks like RSP has to be always aligned to 16 bytes.	0
Some functions don't require it, but some do.	0
A patch was made to the interpreter to fix this in assembly code, so if a native method has an odd number of arguments, additional 8 bytes are skilled by RSP to align it to 16 bytes.	0
Patch applied at 514264.	0
So I am likely going to work on this soon.	0
What is the exact problem?	0
If it would as simple as just recreating ReplicationZookeeper or using RecoverableZookeeper J-D would have probably just done it :)	0
You forgot to mention the part where I said that I have absolutely no idea if MinSize is important for some other part of the code ;)Also, it looks like if we add a check in couch_db:doc_flush_binaries/2 to see if we're not streaming an attachment of unknown length, and then pass that information to couch_stream:ensure_buffer/2 so that couch_stream can decide if it wants to allocate exactly the requested amount or some extra it'd solve the issue.	0
The patch should be relatively trivial, but like I said, I have no idea if there is other important stuff going on there or not.	1
The two issues mentioned by Tom has been fixed.	0
The new patch is the whirr-168-3.patch file.	0
32 bit ubuntu 12.10	0
Marking this for 0.18.4 and above since it's a deadlock.	0
The patch should work on all fair scheduler versions.	0
This blocker/ critcal was created before July please review and resolve, we are approaching 4.2 code freeze in 7 days 	0
Was fixed to behave as it used to.	0
Igor, sorry it took me so long to get back to this.	1
Thanks for the patch.	0
It works for me, both in container and in testing with WicketTester.	0
Hey, sorry I did not get back to you sooner.	1
I found the (sad) attempt at a script you asked about and uploaded it to MAPREDUCE-4282.	1
As I said on that thread, I'm in a compilers class right now and I thought I might make a more "enlightened" attempt using lex/yacc soon and see where that gets me, if no one else gets this done first.	0
Sorry for the delay.	1
anyway, if someone is brave enough to fix the "attempt one" script, i wish them well ;)	0
I added a rm -rf /tmp/h* to hadoopqa... and ran this again.... seems to be working:https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/HBase/job/PreCommit-HBASE-Build/7253/consoleWe'll see.	0
by the way, the only open impl of this algorithm i could find is at http://rrette.com/moman.html (ZSpell) in python.	0
I recently stumbled upon a C++ey STLey impl -> http://code.google.com/p/patl/bq.	0
I might be on the trail of a java impl - get out the hounds!	0
If you do take hold of it, do not hesitate to share :) The original paper and C++ code likewise melt my brain, and I needed the algo in some other place.	0
Go ahead commit Nitay.	0
We can file issues with it as we find them.	0
I don't have resources to hand to test this at mo.	1
Yes it is a dup, thanks Mike for taking care of this (I planned to do this yesterday but didn't make it)	1
Hi Deepa, I looked at the transaction logs, afaict this is not a bug, rather the znode you mention is not deleted on session expiration because it was already explicitly deleted by another session.	0
I dumped the txnlog from zookeeper2, here is the section of interest.	0
afaict things are working properly, at least on the ZK side of things.	0
Fixed a typo in the oritinal patch.	0
toString() method added.	0
FWIW: this issue is a regression of JCR-890, i.e.	0
the refactoring involved (r982520).	0
there might be more hidden issues like this.	0
+1, let's rip it out and redo it if we need it.	0
Forgot to add that I also tried this with and without HBASE-5864	1
but app developers should always explicitly set it based on their applicationMy guess is that a large enough group of people take the defaults that it matters.	1
App developers never do what they should :)	1
problem - the bit to sign the source-release is being called when the source-release isn't being built because the source-release is only built at the "executionroot".  	1
I wasn't talking about the perment schedule.	0
I was talking that the first three months of becoming a TLP we have to report monthly.	0
Kevin, we already have that -- the jobs are named after the file (if you run pig myfile.pig), but you can override the name with "set job.name myname"With this ticket, that job name would essentially become a prefix.	0
Excuse me for stolen assignement.	1
I've saw this after completed the issue.	0
I've rework almost all needed messages in Preconditions.checkArgument.	0
And I did it according the style of each class.	0
I think it will be useful to standardize all the messages.	0
In current version the same error cause different messages because there are many commiters.	1
Example, for case: Preconditions.checkArgument(size >= 0, "size must be at least 0"); we can do like Preconditions.checkArgument(size >= 0, "Wrong size: " + size + ".	0
Must be: size >= 0!	0
Marking this an incompatible change, so that it gets attention.	0
Also, setting webinterface.private.actions has other effects like enabling the 'kill job' and 'kill task' links on the Job web UI.	0
@Joy: I agree that not losing heartbeats is the best scenario.	0
In the case I mentioned in my above comment, we would not lose datanode heartbeats if we implement HDFS-1392.	0
On the other hand, if there is a true network partition, then NN will "lose heartbeats" from datanodes, because the datanodes cannot send messages to the NN.	0
In that case, the NN should delay creating a replication-storm in the hope that the network partition gets resolved soon.	0
So, the heuristic that I listed above to detect a network partition should still be applicable, isn't it?	0

Hi Guillaume,I did not have an answer right away, so I sent you question to Leonard Rosenthol.	1
Here is his response:"There is no reason to change the version in the header as the version can be anything (ISO 19005-2:2005, 6.1.2).	0
As for the OutputIntent, that is not necessary if all colors in the PDF are in a device independent colorspace (ISO 19005-1:2005, 6.2.3.1).	0

Sorry, should have commented on this much sooner.	1
That seems to work for me - thanks!	0
The preliminary patch is attached.	0
It is not yet tested - I ran into strange build problems with APR.	1
Done, sorry for all the mess on a simple patch.	1
David,I've done a little digging and have a question around:  OrderReadHelper.getOrderItemQuantityBd()Firstly going back a while now this log:    http://svn.ofbiz.org/viewcvs/trunk/components/order/src/org/ofbiz/order/order/OrderReadHelper.java?rev=4367&r1=4281&r2=4367shows a change to the strings that seems to make the first if statement redundant?!	0
I presume either that statement can now be removed or the original intention of the statement needs reimplementing?	0
Secondly reading this code I can see why this bug is happening, after completing stage 2 above when adding the new item the code does "ordered - cancelled = quantity" which equates to "1 - 1 = 0".	1
Keep repeating this and the problem just gets worse.	1
scheduleAtFixedRate "Creates and executes a periodic action that becomes enabled first after the given initial delay, and subsequently with the given period; that is executions will commence after initialDelay then initialDelay+period, then initialDelay + 2 * period, and so on.	0
If any execution of the task encounters an exception, subsequent executions are suppressed..."so get() shouldn't be causing a cancel, but if an exception is found then we need to re-schedule it manually.	0
(If you cast the Runnable in afterExecute to ScheduledFutureTask you can get access to the scheduling info.)	0
if get is causing the cancel even w/o any exceptions being involved then I guess you'll need to source dive in ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor to see what is going on.	0
Here are two thread dumps:sling6.thread_dump.01.txt was taken about 10 seconds after a shutdown of Sling was attempted.	0
sling6.thread_dump.02.txt was taken a couple minutes later.	0
I include it because quite a few of the threads from the first dump have stopped by this point.	0
thx todd, missed the ant/ivy stuff, update patch takes care of it (hopefully mavenized gridmix goes in soon and ant/ivy will go away)	0

[~egli] - can you reproduce?	0
If you do, you'd stand a better chance of making a proper fix...	0
(back from holidays, so a bit delayed, but) I confirm Andrzej's suggestion -- a plain-text only summarized is ideal for clustering for example.	1

It would be great, if you could work on it.	0
Thus assigning the issue to you.	0
Thanks.	0
Hi Marco,I changed the name of patch because it was made in Java earliar, sorry for inconvenience.	1
I have uploaded the modified patch "PartyCommunication.patch" and it is ready for testing.	0
This is the reverse side of ARIES 399, which dealt with a deadlock in ServiceRecipe.	0
As mentioned there to fix the issues blueprint code that calls out to any kind of client code (reference listeners, service listeners, initialiser methods) should not hold the full BlueprintRepository lock, which allows deadlocks like the two observed.	0
Or at least the locks need to be much more fine-grained than locking the whole container.	0
I hope the first approach as the more general solution will work though :)	0
Yeah I had a hunch it was a shutdown hook, kicking in at the same time.	0

First guess: something's getting confused about reversed-ness.	1

lifecycle management up to a separate containerAgreed, and my patch also contains a TODO for that.	0
Similar to all other plugins, the life cycle hook should be pluggable in a sense that you can deploy them e.g.	0
in an OSGi container as a separate bundle.	0
Instead of hardcoding the hooks we could introduce a LifeCycleHookProvider similar to ValidatorProvider we already have.	0

Thanks for the reviews, Bikas and Aaron.	0
I said above that the earlier patches were lost, but nope, there they are.	0
Sorry, I took Martin's comment to mean the patch was committed and issue closed, which certainly discarded all the patches the first time around.	1
Anyway, the "-2" patches include all the changes in the first patch files.	0
What platform?	0
Have you tried the standard maven untangling tricks like deleting ~/.m2?	0

Would a new configuration boolean 'fs.manual.shutdown' be adequate for your needs?	0
You could programatically set this before getting your filesystems, and when set true, the shutdown hook would not be added.	0
Vinay, thanks for working on this.	0
Some comments:The new method added to Namesystem is better to# pass BlockInfoUnderConstruction,# call it as isInSnapshot, and# do not throw IOException.	0
{code}//Namesystem.javapublic boolean isInSnapshot(BlockInfoUnderConstruction block);{code}In the implementation in FSNamesystem, it should try-catch the UnresolvedLinkException and log it as an error since the full path obtained from a file should not have unresolved link.	0

It does not look very useful.	1

Unfortunately, in these days where everyone that can put a CDthe right way up in a drive is a Linux/Unix/Windows/Internet Expert, this has become pretty common.	1

@Roger: huh, this is bad, as a partial integration will seg fault, see BoostMonitor.cpp which does a cast of a boost::mutex.	0
It would be *highly* preferable instead to *not* include the BoostMonitor.cpp change, as both are inter-dependent.	0
Alternatively, I don't know what is the compiler error on Debian, but it may very well be missing the include inside BoostMutex.cpp:{code}#include <boost/thread/mutex.hpp>{code}Thanks!	0
That's a very promising idea !	0

I can see why, the test case just checks that the error string includes the exception text "foo".	0
That is a bit too lax I think.	1
The problem is not that the exception text is lost completely, it does come through, just that it is wrapped in an AvroRuntimeException("Unknown datum type: "+datum) error.	0
So instead of the expected "java.lang.RuntimeException: foo" text being sent you get "org.apache.avro.AvroRuntimeException: Unknown datum type: java.lang.RuntimeException: foo".	0
The cause is that the call to SpecificResponder.writeError in Responder.respond ultimately calls GenericData.resolveUnion which in turn calls GenericData.getSchemaName before the line where the UnresolvedUnionException gets thrown.	1
GenericData.getSchemaName instead throws an AvroRuntimeException so the special handling of UnresolvedUnionException in Responder.respond is skipped and the nested exception text is the result.	0
Another option is to create a new type for HdfsLocatedFileStatus as{code}HdfsLocatedFileStatusProto {  HdfsFileStatusProto fs = 1;  LocatedBlocksProto locations = 2;}{code}  	0

Anyway, I am creating a project that began with 2.0.0-M3 and is now using 2.0.0-M4.	0
I have this issue, where my server and client is creating a lot of loopback threads, that I believe must be related to this issue.	1
Any word on whether it will be fixed?	1
that it's a huge patch is exactly why I don't want to take a "let's just commit it and clean it up later" approach.	0
Good idea especially if you have a use case for that.	0
You might also want to consider the induced latency though, depending on the checkpoint size and frequency.	0
Make sure to use the hsync api for persistency guarantees.	0
Do you mean you checked your proposition or mine?	0
Mine is not thourougly thought, it's just a suspenders AND belt solution.	0
Also by "working" do you mean that you checked also for (undesired) side effects?	0

There are a few considerations to be careful about:1) The hostname in service could be a vip name.	0
The token selector is used in ipc.Client, which has InetSocketAddress of the remote server.	0
How do we make sure we are matching the right hostnames?	0
One way to address it is to get the ip address from the hostname service and use that for matching, but that needs a dns lookup.	0
2) Dns lookup in token selector would be invoked for every connection using token authentication.	0
Incomplete example.	0
Unable to reproduce issue.	1
Sounds good Claudio.	0
I used to have the subset of in-memory partitions maintained as a sliding window (i.e.	0
most recently computed K partitions), but I switched to the model with K-1 partitions always in memory and 1 slot for loading out-of-core partitions, because it made the logic slightly simpler.	0
We can go back to something like that if we want to manage that subset more intelligently (2).	0
I would keep the hasActive field in memory (in the PartitionStore).	0
We start with any K in-memory partitions, skip on-disk partitions that have no active vertices or incoming messages, and prioritize spilling partitions that have no active vertices.	0
As I explained the XSL files have nothing to do with FOP, so its impossible for FOP to tell you which file/line number in XSL stylesheet(s) the problem lies at.	0
FOP can only tell you which line in the single FO file the error occurred at.	0
Oh, ok.	1
I'll focus my efforts on the compile targets then.	0
We'll have plenty of time to go through the bundles later.	0
gora-cassandra is patched to work with this prove of concept (It's just a one-liner in CassandraStore).	0

Could we remove the setProperty() implementation in HierarchicalConfigurationand use the default implementation in AbstractConfiguration ?	0
ThusfetchInsertIterator could be made private.	0
This will always work, irrespectively of the combination of various underlying technologies and it will be a thread-safe solution :public class GroupsResource {    private UriInfo uriInfo;    private GroupResource gr1 = new GroupResource();    @Context    public void setUriInfo(UriInfo ui) {        uriInfo = ui;        gr1.setUriInfo(uriInfo);     }    @Path("group1")    public GroupResource group1() {        return gr1;    }    @Path("group2")    public GroupResource group2() {        GroupResource gr2 = new GroupResource();        gr2.setUriInfo(uriInfo);         return gr2;    }}It will also work well in cases when users try to do proxy-based client invocations, as client proxies do not support @Context parameters on resource methods.	0
In meantime I will see what I can do with respect to the context injection into subresources... Perhaps in some cases modifying the subresource classes with extra methods might not be an option.	0
that we have an overridable method is not by accidentWe want that so that we dont keep the state in the component.	0
