I tripped across one puzzling sentence, but it wasn't something that you changed: In the second, longer paragraph of the BUILTIN bullet, we recommend LDAP and user-supplied schemes as alternatives to BUILTIN, but we don't recommend NATIVE.	0
Did we decide to not recommend NATIVE here or should this be adjusted to include it beside the other safe schemes?	0

Ok cool, this is just a matter of adding strings to the various [NotFound()|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/0.15.0-rc4/src/files/files.cpp#L160] returns in files.cppThere are a number of error cases in the [browse|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/0.15.0-rc4/src/files/files.cpp#L204] and [read|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/0.15.0-rc4/src/files/files.cpp#L204] endpoints, I'd imagine one could change the javascript to generate bad requests which should be sufficient to test this :)	1

I did a review and I found the problem is not on tomahawk.	0
Really it is a side effect of the browser (IE 7 and IE 8).	0

Interesting that you decided not to detect the error based on finding two similarly-named operations.	1
I wonder if there are any advantages to your way of doing it over mine, but I think yours will definitely work to detect the error cases I had in mine.	0
Fair enough.	0

Thanks Arpit!	0
I think your logic is right.	0
This is what I understand.	0
1	0
FileSystemView is the user file system view so it can have canDelete() and canRead() methods ..... this is fine.	0
2	0
FileSystemView can have user object to indicate whose file system view it is representing.	0
3	0
In that case, caching will be at the FileSystemView level (not at FileObject level).	0
Logically this is also fine.	0
NativeFileSystemView represents the underlying OS file system view - no more no less.	0
Caching is a specialized function.	0
So if necessary we can add another FileSystemManager implementation which will support caching.	0
But it may not be appropriate to add this in NativeFileSystem classes.	0
So the action items:1. canDelete(), canRead() and canWrite() will be moved to FileSystemView from FileObject. 	0
Please review and close out if appropriate.	0

We pretty much already had the interface we wanted for this (IFixedLocationResourceStream).	0
I only needed to let MarkupResourceStream also implement it.	0
And then MarkupCache uses that interface to checkout what the actual file isI dont think we will get IResourceStream implementation that are not File or URL and if we do then we fallback on the cachekey only approache.	0
It seems to work fine for me when i test locally, the markup is only created once per fixed location and then access throughcachekey -> locationstring -> markupSo if locationString doesn't work we get this:cachekey -> cachekey -> markupBut i guess that is a very small percentage if there is even 1 on this planet...should we include this into 1.3.2?	0

Hi Suran,The new catalogs_b.patch looks very good.	1
It will need another round or two of adjusting but it is definitely looking solid.	0
I have applied the patch and am running regression tests now.	0
I will post my results when the tests finish.	0
I have some comments on the new patch:PermDescriptoro You should remove the permUUID field from this class since it shadows the oid field in the superclass.	0
In my experience, this kind of shadowing always causes bugs in the future because it is so easy to lose track of which copy of the redundant field is being used.	0
So the constructor for this class should call setUUID( permUUID ) rather than stuffing the shadowing field via "this.permUUID = permUUID".	0
o Once you do that, you can get rid of the getUUID(), setUUID(), and getObjectID() methods in this class.	0
o I have reservations about the second constructor for this class (the one which is used to create a key descriptor rather than a full-fledged permissions descriptor).	0
However, I see that you are following the data dictionary patterns for the other permissions descriptors.	0
I think you are right to follow the existing patterns.	0
But we should put a sticky note on our brains to remind ourselves to clean up this pattern in the future--partially initialized data is brittle.	0
This is something we can revisit when we collapse all of the permissions catalogs into the master catalog which you are creating.	0
Don't worry, that's another project and not part of the sequence generator work.	0
SYSSEQUENCESRowFactoryo I think that you should flip the order of the keys in the second index.	0
That is, the key order should be ( schemaID, sequenceName ) rather than ( sequenceName, schemaID ).	0
This will speed up the check in DataDictionaryImpl.isSchemaEmpty().	0
But maybe you have a use for an index with key order ( sequenceName, schemaID ) which I'm not seeing.	0
If so, then I would recommend adding a third index.	0
Note that if you swap the key order, then you will need to make a corresponding change to DataDictionaryImpl.getSequenceDescriptor(String, SchemaDescriptor)o I think that buildColumnList() should return an array of 10 column descriptors, one for each column in the table.	0
See, for instance, the corresponding method in SYSALIASESRowFactory.	0
SYSROLESRowFactoryo As with SYSSEQUENCESRowFactory, I think that buildColumnList() should return a larger array, one cell for each column in the table.	0
DataDictionaryo The header comment for getPermDescriptor() does not seem to describe the method.	0
EmptyDictionaryo I think that you can remove the stub for dropSequenceDescriptor(String, TransactionController) because you have removed this method from the DataDictionary interface.	0
DataDictionaryImplo The header comments on getUncachedPermDescriptor() getPermDescriptor(), and dropAllPermDescriptors() look like they were copied from pre-existing methods, so they should be revised to describe the new methods.	0
Thanks,-Rick	0
See previous comments for earlier commit.	0
This one fixes the end-date issue in the comment bean classes:URL: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=782269&view=revAnd that resolves this issue in the trunk.	0

Hey Chris,you just moved the files right?!	0
Vinicus patch only includes a single file (the failing junit), all Uwe need to do is to apply the patch to the moved file, is that correct?	0
Also applies to the 4.x series	0
The behaviour still occurs in the last snapshot using both Mojarra 2.1 or MyFaces.	0

It looks like the problem originates in PDFBOX-11.	0
Many CID mappings are expressed as ranges, which the code explodes into individual Integer->String pairs.	0
This causes pretty big data structures as many of our CMaps cover 65k possible mappings!	0

Hi David,This helps me understand what you were talking about - thanks!	0

I'll make those changes as soon as I can.	0
#NAME?	0
Patch applied in trunk.	0
I have added some buttons to help put variables and patterns.	0
Thank you for your contribution.	0
applies to trunk, too	0
Also #3 seems to be fairly simple with a single "around" advice in aspectj and a couple of lines for ajc target in build.xml.	0
Why use an ad-hoc script that's known (according Erik himself) to have false positive that require manual inspection (which is also not part of the version controlled source tree), when you we have a built-in (aspectj*.jars are already included as build/runtime dependencies) tool specifically for such tasks?	0
You can do this for info messages too for more performance when that is off.	0
There are no extra lines of code or maintenance; it is the simplest solution.	0
As long as the change is applied at build time, I don't see any real drawback.	0
Ah, ok ... thanks for the heads up.	0
There's a note on the main page about these scripts, but you're right: nothing obvious in some of hte "sub pages"I'll take a stab at clarifying.	0
Changes to the test look good, and your method for finding which are right/wrong is correct.	0
I would advise that a good thing to do once you have fixed this issue is to then perform a similar test modification for setting a valid value and using batching.	0
I've started to work towards support for visualising services and cascading configuration.	0
The changes in this patch aren't a complete solution but they're free-standing give basic service visualisation and shared configuration support.	0
I've introduced a decorator framework for relationships so we can draw the service triangles (or package names).	0
The service handling will need to be updated slightly once we're not working from the DummyInfoProvider.	0
Handling of services which aren't consumed and services which are consumed by multiple bundles is pretty weak.	0
I've also started to add cascading configuration.	0
I've added a Theme class and a ComponentAppearance class which takes defaults from the theme and allows them to be over-ridden.	0
ComponentAppearances will also inherit from one another when we have nested components (like a bundle inside an application).	0
I've only switched the ComponentColorElement (which was the ComponentColorProperty) over to use the new configuration so far, but I'll switch the other elements over to using the new configuration next.	0
In the new version, elements have two methods - render(), which draws them, and apply() which initialises shared properties like colour.	0
This allows for a two-phase rendering.	0
Apply isn't the best name but we're already using update(), so suggestions welcome.	0
:)I've renamed ComponentColorProperty to be ComponentColorElement and RelationshipAggregation to TwistieAggregation.	1
I've also moved RelationshipElement to the elements namespace.	0
These are all svn file deletions which will need to be done by hand when applying the hand.	0
Applied patch	0
Looks like this is fixed :)	1
Version 2.2.0RC3 is fine.	1

Hi Preben,I just applied the your patch with a minor modification on FtpConsumerWithCharsetTest.testConsumerWithCharset to use UTF_8 charset by default.	0
For the CAMEL-3787, I think the key should be on the ftp client configure to find out right charset that the server is using.	0

The attached patch fixes two problems:  * the first one which happen when the class is loaded from the boot classloader (in which case, we now use the system classloader to load the enclosing class)  * the second one which is the fact that all kind of linkage errors can happen when loading the class and this would really disturb the classloader correct behavior	0
Could you please verify and/or adapt your patch against the current version at http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/proper/jcs/branches/generics-interface I was not able to apply your patch there.	0
A potentially legitimate use case of a {{set}} without an {{apply}} is a builder class that should not be accessed until the building is complete, at which point the internal state will be accessed directly to produce the final result of some type.	0
Such a class does not really need an {{apply}} method.	0
However, as a tactical decision imposed by the implementation of the typechecker, we will require a matching {{apply}} method for every {{set}} method, and will reassess this issue later in the context of a possible typechecker redesign.	0

Jacopo,Thanks for diving in a pointing Scott at the appropriate screens.	0
David,I completely agree that providing more intelligence in the PO creation process would be very helpful, especially for larger businesses.	0
I can just about cope with the amount of manual intervention required, but in the not too distant future I can see the need for some of the rules you suggest.	0
The idea of consolidating POs (or SOs, I guess) came mainly because I end up having multiple small POs for some of my suppliers.	0
However, I also run into the opposite problem.	0
For my larger suppliers, I will often have a 100 or more requirements built up.	0
Since the "Approved Requirements" screen paginates the requirements, I'll end up generating multiple orders for the same (large) supplier, simply because the application operates a page at a time.	0
This annoys my suppliers a bit.	0
I guess the obvious thing to do is to go in and reconfigure the pagination so it doesn't (paginate), but if we had the ability to add items to existing POs then you could still use the pagination mechanism and build up the PO page-by-page (quite handy if your working through  your POs during less busy times of the day).	0
This should have been fixed by commit 26a5b76ee6b77909a7b8d5b00924f12e1671373d.	0
Verified on my vmware setup, extract volume is working fine now.	0
I did that first, but then remembered that when I did that in the past, people were unable to apply my patches, w/o doing the svn move themselves.	0
Anyway, for this file it's not really important I think - a very simple and tiny file, w/ no history to preserve?	0
Is that ok for this file (b/c I have no idea how to do the svn move now ... after I've made all the changes already) :)	1
Please keep this open until reverse tests are configured, as we might have new issues coming from them.	0

HadoopQA uses -p0 to apply patches.	0
Ok, got it, thanks for the explanation.	0
In any case, the code for the toBytes method is written now, so it should be a simple thing to move it to the PType implementation classes.	0
It would probably also be worth having optimized versions for primitive values, instead of writing them to an Avro/Writable first to get the bytes representation.	0
But yeah, that's for another JIRA.	0
An example patch.	0
Was unable to run the unit test I wrote (because my setup is being a jerk), but I'm more looking for input on the design.	0

I seem to be having trouble applying the patches, though, and I'd hate for all these corrections and improvements to be lost.	0

Do the same tests work fine on 1.5.0dev?	0
One of the things I changed in jnr-posix, was to make stat and fstat use stati64 and fstati64 respectively, instead of stat64 and fstat - the last may be why its breaking with jna-posix.	0
Look in WindowsLibCFunctionMapper.java for the fstat mapping - it may all magically work if you change fstat to map to _fstat64 (note: no 'i' in the name - uses stat64 struct instead of stati64 ... they have different sized atime, ctime, mtime fields).	0
Otherwise, the WindowsFileStat structure looks ok, apart from the st_blocks and st_blksize fields at the end, which are not part of the windows stat64 struct, so will probably be filled with either zero, or garbage.	0
Awesome. Thats great to hear!	0
