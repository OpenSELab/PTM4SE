This issue is still present in 3.4.0.GA.	Neutral
actually, why shouldn't it be possible to use only @Id deprecating @EmbeddableId ?	Neutral
note that @id @Type ComplexObject is a valid approach	Neutral

+1 will commit. Yikes just crazy to see something like this.	Stress
My apologies - original patch was malformed.	Depression
I am confused the patch has - not +. It looks like it is removing the feature.	Depression

I committed this patch to trunk and branch-2. 	Neutral
I committed the patch to trunk and branch-2.	Neutral
May be a dupe of HDFS-3048.	Neutral
The typo in the JIRA summary scared me - thought you meant some sort of GUID. :)	Relax
+1, thanks for the cleanup, glad to be rid of that code.	Relax
@Uma: My pleasure! and Thanks for reviewing :)	Excited
bq. 0.23.1 doesn't have protobufs in place yet, right? Whoops! Of course you're right. :)	Depression

Yes, one file missing in the patch. Sorry for the mistake	Depression
Adding the version solved the prob:).  Crazy!!!! I was trying  out something else :(	Stress
Finding the wrong findbugs is boring (I need to move forward on the zero findbugs). Will do that before committing. For the line > 100, one is new, I will fix it, the others are in  EventHandler and it's because we comment on the same line as the declaration. I plan to keep this.	Stress
Moving out though I think it a shame we don't have it.  It is not being worked on.	Depression

No worries Jimmy.  That'll do.  Thanks. Let me commit. 	Relax
You are right I confused the two. I don't have an opinion on HBASE-4908.	Depression
This stuff scares me. How do you manually recover from this?	Stress

Renamed the issue, and discared the problem of visibility, it deserves another issue	Neutral
Can you go a little bit farther? I'm afraid I don't get what you really want.	Stress
I'm afraid this will be a bit difficult to fix for 2.0.  We have to think about it for 3.0, IMO.	Stress
Fixed.  Thanks for the patch! :)	Excited
Sorry, I was confused. :-$	Depression
Very very odd when I try to build again it all works this time.  I'm confused.  	Depression

Nobody notices an old dusty guy in the corner :-(	Depression
No worries -- just close it as not a bug ;-) 	Relax

Stupidity. I was looking at the 'work' directory.	Depression
This is not a bug...just poor reading of the documentation on my part :)	Depression
Duplicate of parent jira :-(	Depression
There're 4 files in the. Zip is a pleasure to contribute.	Neutral

The problem is still present with version 2.2.1 :-(  Is there a workaround ?	Depression
THis was just stupid.	Depression
Seems not to work :-(	Depression

Ok, no worries, I'll look at it again. 	Relax
so attached the project .. sorry for the delay ... had a terrible flu   If you need anything more , let me know 	Stress
I began to track the first one but I don't yet succeed to find where it comes from :-(	Depression
The fix for MPSITE-28 created this problem :-/	Stress
I would have voted for this.  Seems a shame to shut it down so quickly.	Depression

Fixed for 6.0.0.CR4. Thanks for reporting, Reinis! :)	Excited
@Henrik thanks! If it's good, I 'll merge it :)	Excited

Hm, not resolved in 4.5.6.1 :-/	Stress

I'm sorry, but now my project classes are doubled in the right place in package hierarchy :-(	Depression
I'm really anxious for this fix. Is it available as a snapshot anywhere?	Stress
IMHO those binaries are based on wrapper which is not anymore ASF license compatible. so bad :-(	Depression
[~rafabene] I can't actually see it, which is probably a bad sign :-/	Stress
out of date, stupid idea	Depression
And that closing '-->' is a typo .... when pasting. Sorry .. :-(	Depression
Way outside my expertise, unfortunately.	Depression
I'm glad they fixed it. I thought that was really strange behavior. Thanks Hiro.	Relax
Unfortunately yes :-(	Depression
Nice, that sounds good. Is it already in master? I'm excited to see the improvements in action :)	Excited
It is always peculiar when we perform more poorly than 1.9. I'll poke around a bit.	Depression

Good, simple fix. Committed in 4447.	Relax
I really need this. I'm anxious!	Stress
I'm confused about where the JAR is.  I don't see it anywhere in Seam.	Depression
Yes, well JSF exception handling is very poor. Dan, do you have a proposed solution for seam-gen?	Stress
yes,you are right, apologize for my poor english.	Depression
Yup, you are right, I got confused about when I did the changes.	Depression
Unfortunately still no joy in getting this to build.	Depression
Eugh, this is really nasty	Stress

Unfortunately hardcoded in eXo Kernel	Depression
We would need a complete review :-/	Stress
Still happening on Tomcat :-/	Stress
Probably won't have the time to look at it for 3.0 Final :-/	Stress
I personally like the serif versions more as it gives the forge a little more pop.  Yes the sans version is consistent with the main site, but then again that's what makes it more boring.	Depression
